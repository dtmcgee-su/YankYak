My proposal idea is a website revolving around the New York Yankees. Ideally, I would like to have a page that shows the most recent
news, along with games, scores, and stats. I would also like to have a page that is based on blogs that my brother and I write about
the team throughout the season. I also think it would be a good idea to include a social page where it links to all of my 
social media. I am very passionate about ths idea because this is a project I could see myself advancing on in the future.
